## Bitcoin Only Meetup

In light of the old bitcoin only meetup not running, we would like to ressurect this, and also get some bitcoin only discussion again.

The format is free for all, and ideally will rotate venues to showcase and support bitcoin only meetups. Please message **@nolim1t** on telegram or discord (ID: *nolim1t#2650* or pop into [this server](https://discord.gg/2qcBpH) ) and do share your place. Ideally we are looking at places which offer a discount for bitcoin users. We are also happy to assist in setting up your business for accepting bitcoin for free.

| October 28th | [Sababa Restaurant](https://g.page/SababaCM?share) | Bitcoin Only 2.0 Meetup #1 | First of the Bitcoin only 2.0 series. Will host this at Sababa at 7pm. This venue accepts lightning and bitcoin and has many options. | ü•©üå± |
